*       The `unknown' status is not really dumped by the OBDS code, it *

*       can happen if an unexpected error occurs (without fail-safe)   *
*       The `pending' status signals the shell script to submit the    *
*       job to the HPC because the simulation has not ended yet. The   *
*       `done' status is dumped by the OBDS code when the simulation   *
*       finishes, that happens the step counter is equal to NUM_STEPS. *

*       NOTE:

*       this design constraint only if you know what you are doing.    *
*       If all that you want is to achieve a certain volume fraction   *
*       that can be done more easily by adjusting the system LIMIT. We *
*       use configs that can be expressed as powers of two because     *
*       these have exact binary floating-point representations.        *
