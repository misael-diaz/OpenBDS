! The vector class presented by Koening and Moo inspired me to write my
! own in FORTRAN. I borrowed some of their ideas to implement it.


! Comments:
! A vector is a container that holds values of the same type.


! Comments on Procedures:
!
! subroutine vector_int32_t_create()
! Allocates one more element on purpose to compute the size of the
! vector via: (end - begin) as in c++.
!
! function findloc_wrapper_method (self, value) result(idx)
! lower and upper bounds (lb, ub) are chosen so that we do not include
! the element pointed to by (end). It's a valid index but it should not
! be referenced since it does not hold an actual value.
!
! subroutine clear_method()
! Placing the `avail' iterator at the beginning is equivalent to
! clearing the vector without deallocating memory. I have designed
! the vector class thinking on how it will be used for keeping
! track of neighbors. In that context it's convenient to
! clear the vector without deallocating memory since it would
! be expensive to have to grow the size of the vector over and
! over again during the simulation. Why not use fixed-size arrays?
! I have use them in the past worrying that I might have to allocate
! more memory than actually needed to avoid exceding the array
! bounds. Some systems might be more dynamic having particles with
! far more neighbors than others. Vectors would come in handy for
! such cases.
